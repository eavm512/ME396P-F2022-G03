# brainstorm data structure

# comm_simulation
- initial sketch on how to sort data from bluetooth from sensor
- the exact logistics would go on to change as the sanitize function was finally built

# sonar_demo_data
- an intial set of data that the ESP32 bluetooth board would feed to python (and sanitize)
- the data would later change, and example data is now stored in the emulator within ESP_BT_Handler.py
