# Arduino sensing and posting to flask min product
- a video of a very early prototype of the product aimed to demonstrate that the sensors worked, and that we could communicate over serial.
- Used an Arduino Mega and the same ultrasonic sensor we would eventually go with to detect items in front of items
- Used serial communication over USB to send information to python, which direclty hosted very simplistic Flask app saying if "bay" was available
- Did not have logging capability
- Did not have multi-slot capability (no implemented classes)

# Bike Sensor on Rack
- image of our final hardware setup mounted on a UT bike rack on campus

# Bluetooth_comm_on_rack_movie
- video of the hardware sensing something in front of it and sending that information over bluetooth
- The data is being shown in a basic bluetooth reading application, which was used for debugging the hardware
