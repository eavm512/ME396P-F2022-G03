# This directory contains photos and videos of the product working at various phases.

## Videos of Final Product
* Contains videos of various aspects of the final product working with hardware in case the reviewer does not have hardware
* Contains videos showing off scalability of solution (eg multiple racks and bays being supported by Flask app) we didn't create hardware for

## Arduino sensing and posting to flask min product
* a video of a very early prototype of the product aimed to demonstrate that the sensors worked, and that we could communicate over serial
* Used an Arduino Mega and the same ultrasonic sensor we would eventually go with to detect items in front of items
* Used serial communication over USB to send information to python, which direclty hosted very simplistic Flask app saying if "bay" was available
* Did not have logging capability
* Did not have multi-slot capability (no implemented classes)

## Bike Sensor on Rack
* image of our final hardware setup mounted on a UT bike rack on campus

## Bluetooth_comm_on_rack_movie
* video of the hardware sensing something in front of it and sending that information over bluetooth
* The data is being shown in a basic bluetooth reading application, which was used for debugging the hardware
