Idea candidates for G03

Ideas for better group name:
-Go Go Go
-"with team as successful_group:"
-smart quotes


Arduino as Lab environment for education / DAQ
-set up Python based application (maybe GUI maybe set of command line functions) to interface arduino for lab experiments
-We pre-cook the lab experiments
-Some prior ideas could be experiments / demos
	-Plant water / humidity sensor
	-Fruit ripeness poker
	-proximity sensor
-Provides ability to save data coming in from arduino.

Bike rack availability monitor
-Displays if there are available spots at a given bike rack online
-Concerns:
	-mechanism to detect rack is available / not
		-visual?
		-Contact (varies too much?)

Parking Space availability monitor
-if spaces area available, turn on light or add to sign 50' away
-Similar to bike rack, but cars park more consistently than bikes.
