Script to allow Arduino Uno with button attached to send serial messages
to this computer which then sends appropriate serial messages to 
arduino Leonardo which has LED that turns on / off.

Change DELAY_TIME to increase refresh rate.
Change MAX_TIME to increase / decrease iterations

Make sure to use serial.close() to close connections if programs quits
early (or just kill the console)

Other serial connections (eg Arduino ID serial monitor or uploader) will
prevent serial library in python from connecting.

Make sure to update the first arguments of the serial.Serial object creators
with the appropriate COM ports for your computer.

To see what ports you have available:
from serial.tools import list_ports
list_ports.main()
